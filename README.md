Xfluid is a FPS optimizer script for the X-Plane flight simulator. It can be used to keep the FPS count above a required limit. Default FPS limit is set to 30 but can be changed by editing the script. 

# showFPS

showFPS is a popup displying current FPS. Works in 2D and VR. It also shows additional information like "real time", current position, LOD level, slip angle of teh aircraft. The script will create a new command which allows to open/close the popup by pressing a key or joystick button.

# Requirements

Both scipts require the FlyWithLua NG plugin being installed.

Both scripts work with X-Plane 11 and X-Plane 12.
